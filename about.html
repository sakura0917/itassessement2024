        <h3>Hello,</h3><br>

My name is Sakura Basyal, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you. I come from Lalitpur, Nepal where I've spent most of my life soaking up experiences and learning from the diverse perspectives around me.

Professionally, I have a background in Computer Science, I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science with an aim of becoming a web developer.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm passionate about travelling and exploring. Whether it's exploring new hiking trails, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, I always find joy in pursuing my interests.

I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm excited to connect with each of you to exchange ideas, share experiences, and embark on new adventures together.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to getting to know each of you better as well.</p>
